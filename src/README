* v1.pl - naive implementation of unconstrained sampling and inference not using Cussen's algorithms
* v2-inference-standard.pl - exact inference from Cussen's paper without the sharing optimizations
* slp.pl - final and most relevant version,
    exact inference (marginal and success-constrained) with sharing optimizations
    + sampling (unconstrained loglinear and success-constrained backtrackable model) from Cussen's paper

known bugs
---
* twice repeated output of P=1 for inference_SC_test(dq(a),P) --> too many choice points left

sampling/inference (SC, UC): uniform output for goals that don't t
sampling tests/demo
special sampling with SC inference

sample_SC sometimes errors for goals with shared vars:
  sample_SC((s(X,Y), r(Y,Z))).
solution: do those cases with retrying variant of loglinear UC sampling

sample_SC insufficiently binds outputs when denom gets recalculated

sample_SC has spurious backtracking in denom recalculation case
?- sample_SC((s(X,Y), r(Z,W))).
0.95
Z = a,
W = b .
?- sample_SC(r(b,W)).
0.19999999999999996 (===0.2)


sample_SC cant just assert / retract at will, it doesnt work
sample_SC(r(b,W)).
--> sum_remaining computes 0.2
now we mustnt assert the below, because that changes semantics
--> assertz((1::r(b, _292):-p(_292))
instead, it now says r doesnt sum to 1 with check_unitarity!
