min:
    * working interpreter for Stochastic Logic Programs, written in prolog
        either meta- or via AST (parse with definite clause grammar)
        invent syntax (or use the one from ex. sheets)
        + should be able to compute basic probabilities
        + sampling for a Stochastic Logic Program (generating worlds)
max:
    * implement parameter learning
        possibly efficiently (inference + sampling)
    * something to aid programmer in meeting requirements
        + all clauses add to 1
    * algorithms: from Stephen Muggleton paper
